Have you seen The Lord of the Rings? Do you remember the Door of Durin? Where Gandalf couldn't remember how to enter and the fellowship almost got eaten?

The experience through this book will feel like that. Sometimes you will be stuck, and I mean really really stuck, and at some point, as if the cosmos itself colludes, something will click, and you will level up. Sadly I can not know when this will happen to **you**, as every person is different.

## [DAY-0] How to Google

Anything you don't know how to do, you should use google to search for answers. However it is not easy to know what is good link to read and what is not, try to read from verified sources, like wikipedia, python.org, stackoverflow, mozilla and university websites, ask your parent to help.

There is a lot of scams on the internet, you will open websites that claim you have viruses on your computer and you need to pay 20$ to clean it, or that you need to install this amazing program that will speed up your internet. Sometimes on very trusted websites you will see ads that are pure scams, for example ads that looks like Download buttons to get the program you wanted, but it will just download a virus.

Its getting increasingly difficult to distinguish between good and bad information as well, some websites are just poorly written articles, so they can make people clicking on them in order to get money from ads. With time, and with the help of your parent you will learn how to recognize the good articles.

The rules about how to use the internet are:

* The internet is sus!
* Never put your real name or phone number or address anywhere
* Never download anything unless your parent approves
* Never run anything you downloaded (sometimes downloads just start automatically)
* Don't trust messages like 'click here to get free iPhone' or 'clean your computer for free'
* Always ask your parent for help if you are not sure.

There is noting free on the internet. Even this book, even though I am writing it for free, and you can get it for free, but I am hosting it on GitHub (and I don't pay for that), and GitHub, and therefore Microsoft, knows you are reading it, and later they will use that information to show you better ads, or maybe they will use it for some other purpose, like to train a machine to create artificial text, but one thing you must remember is that there is nothing free on the internet.

## [DAY-1] Touch Typing

Touch typing is just typing without looking, if you are super slow while typing you will get frustrated too soon.

Use https://www.keybr.com/ or ask someone to recommend you something. After using the touch typing app for few days, write your own.


## [DAY-2] Install python

In general the first thing you should do when you don't know how to do something is to google it.

So google 'how to install python', you will see lots of results, some of them will tell you how to install the old version of python, and some will be for the too old or too new version of windows. This makes things a bit more difficult.

Try to download from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and do it yourself, ask your parent for help if you are stuck.


## [DAY-2] Make a useful program

After you have installed python3 run IDLE (ask your parent for help) and go to File -> New File and type:
