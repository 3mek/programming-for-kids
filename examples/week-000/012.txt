'br' means line break, when the browser sees it know it has to show whatever comes next on another line, 'hr' means horizontal rule,just like when you take your ruler and draw a line from left to right in the text book. You see, even though you write things in separate lines (like the word first and line are clearly on separate lines), the browser will not know what to do until you tell it to 'br'. Maybe in school you had a project you have to use PowerPoint to make a presentation? With the special words ul, li, br, hr, h2 and b you can make your own presentation in HTML!


## [DAY-5] HTML

The app you are using right now to see this website is called a web browser, I don't know if kids still call it like that, but adults do.

First the browser app downloads the web page, which is just a normal text file (it is what you see when you click on View Source), then it has to process it, in the same way you read pigpen code or ascii code, you look symbol by symbol and try to make sense out of it by making it into letters you understand.

It looks for word between '<' and then '>', when it sees '<' it knows what ever is between '<' and '>' is important word. Then it has kind of a table so it know what to do with different words, when it sees 'b' it knows that whatever is inside is gonna get **bold**. There are many words like that you should try for yourself 'b' 'i' 'u' 'h1', and many more.

For example, try this on your page: `<b>this is bold</b>`
