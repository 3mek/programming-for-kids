* how to check if string starts with "goto "
    if line.startswith("goto "):
       print("yey")


* how to split a string
  .split(separator) is a method you call on the string
  it returns a list splitted by the separator
    line = "d 25"
    x = line.split(" ")
    x is a list ["d","25"]

  you can also use destructuring to directly assign
  the list into separate variables
    a,b = line.split(" ")
  a is "d"
  b is "25"


* how to convert string to a number:
    x = ["hello","this","is"]
    a = "5"
    n = int(a)

  access the element at index n from the list x
    print(x[n])

* insert into a list in a specific position

    a = ["hello","world"]
    x = 1
    a.insert(x, "beautiful")
    print(a)
  prints ['hello', 'beautiful', 'world']

  if you try to insert beyond the list size, it will
  just add it to the end

    x = 20
    a.insert(x, "zzz")
    print(a)
  prints ['hello', 'beautiful', 'world', 'zzz']


* string formatting
  python has 'f' strings, which are formatted strings

    i = 2
    print(f"hello {i:05}")
  prints 00002, so it will make sure it will occupy
  5 spaces, filling with 0, this is handy if you want
  to print things with the same width.

  e.g. lets say you have this lines:
  0: hello
  1: world
  ...
  9: good
  10: morning


  see how 'morning' is one space to the right, because 10
  has one more symbol than 9, so with print(f"{i:02}")
  it will look like this:

  00: hello
  01: world
  ...
  09: good
  10: morning



* example code:

    x = []
    # start at -1, because we always insert on the "next line"
    # and in the beginning the next line is going to be 0
    # so we need to start at -1
    position = -1
    while True:
        a = input("> ")
        if a == "goto 5":
            position = 5
        else:
            # insert at the next line
            position += 1
            x.insert(position, a)
            for line in x:
                print(line)



* example how to show which line we have the position on
  use f strings in your solution

    def printWithLineNumbers(a, position):
        print("=" * 40)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if i == position:
                print("*" + str(i) + ": " + a[i])
            else:
                print(" " + str(i) + ": " + a[i])
        print("=" * 40)
