* read the user input and add it into a list:
  lines = []
  while True:
      a = input("> ")
      lines.append(a)

* print list of lines with their line number, and
some header and footer of =====..x40:
  print("=" * 40)
  for i in range(len(lines)):
      print(str(i) + " " + lines[i])
  print("=" * 40) 
     
* join list of lines into a string:
  lines = ["a","b","c"]
  s = "\n".join(lines)

  will make the string:
  a
  b
  c
      

* read the lines of a file:
  lines = []
  name = "hello.txt"
  with open(name, "r") as f:
      lines = f.read().splitlines()

* write list of lines to a file:
  name = "hello.txt"
  with open(name, "w") as f:
      f.write("\n".join(lines))


* check if string starts with the word "save"
  s = "save hello.txt"
  if s.startswith("save "):
      print("yes it does")

* split a string into two parts:
  s = "save hello.txt"
  a,b = s.split(" ")

  a is "save"
  b is "hello.txt"
