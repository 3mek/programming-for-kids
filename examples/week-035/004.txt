* how to check if string starts with "d "
    if line.startswith("d "):
       print("yey")


* how to split a string
    line = "d 25"
    a,b = line.split(" ")
    # a is "d"
    # b is "25"

* how to convert string to a number:
    x = ["hello","this","is"]
    a = "5"
    n = int(a)

    # access the element at index n from the list x
    print(x[n])

* how to delete a item from a list
    x = ["hello","this","is"]

    # delete the element on index 1
    del x[1]

    # or you can use pop(1) to
    # remove and return the value at index 1
    a = x.pop(1)

    # or just use x.pop(1) if you dont care about
    # the element it is returning
    x.pop(1)


* if you try to access a list beyond its size it will
  crash, so you need to check if a number fits to be
  used as an index

    n = 5
    if n < len(lines):
       print("yey")
