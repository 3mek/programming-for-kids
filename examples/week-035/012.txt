MAKE BIG STRING:

  # make a string containing "hello\n" 500 times:
  a = "hello\n" * 500


WRITE TO A FILE:

  # with open and close
  name = "1.txt"
  f = open(name, "w")
  s = "hello\n"
  f.write(s)
  f.close()


  # or using `with` so it automatically closes the file:
  name = "1.txt"
  s = "hello\n"
  with open(name, "w") as f:
      f.write(s)
