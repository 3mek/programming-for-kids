* ask the user to name 3 friends
* ask the user to input 3 numbers for their age
* print each name with its age

HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

name> Jacki
name> Penny
name> John
age> 11
age> 10
age> 3

Jacki is 11 years old
Penny is 10 years old
John is 3 years old


HINTS:

* use for i in range(3) to get input 3 times
* use names.append(...) to append something to the list names
* if you have the list names and the list ages, think about what you
  have on index 0 in each list, e.g. names[0] and ages[0]
  again, use for i in range(3) to do something 3 times
  and think about the value of 'i' in the for loop and how you can use
  it to access the correct index from the lists
