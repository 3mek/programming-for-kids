* UNIQUE INPUTS

ask the user to enter 10 strings, and after they are done,
print only the unique ones

> asda
> zz
> asda
...
unique inputs:
asda, zz


HINTS:

in a dictionary table, the keys are unique
a = {}
a["aaa"] = "hello"
a["aaa"] = "bzbz"
print(a["aaa"]) will print 'bzbz' because we will
overwrite the value for the key 'aaa'


* UNIQUE ELEMENTS IN A LIST

write a function, that takes a list of numbers, and returns a new list only with
the unique elements


def uniq(a):
    b = []
    # ...
    return b



print(uniq([1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,4]))

# should print
# [1,2,3,4]

HINTS:
dictionary keys can be integers as well, e.g.:

a = {}
b = 88
a[b] = 5

print(a[b])
