UNIQUE WORD COUNT


read a file and count how many times each word appears
lets say we have the file "aaa.txt" with the following text:

What will we do with a drunken sailor?
What will we do with a drunken sailor?
What will we do with a drunken sailor?
Early in the morning!
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Early in the morning!
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Early in the morning!


the output should be:

What: 3

do: 3
with: 6
a: 6
drunken: 3
sailor?: 3
Early: 4
in: 4
the: 4
