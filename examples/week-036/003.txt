* ask the user to name 5 book
* ask the user which year each book was published
* ask the user to enter each book's author
* print each book with its author and year

HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

book> Tom de Groot 3
book> Tom de Groot 4
book> Sam
year> 1996
year> 1997
year> 1998
year> 1999
year> 2000
author> Liz Pichon
author> Liz Pichon
author> Liz Pichon
author> Liz Pichon
author> Lincoln Pierce

HINTS:

* use for i in range(5) to get input 5 times
* use authors.append(...) to append something to the list authors
* if you have the list names and the list ages, think about what you
  have on index 0 in each list, e.g. authors[0] and years[0] and books[0]
  again, use for i in range(5) to do something 5 times
* use f strings (format strings) to print
  e.g.
  
  a = 1
  b = 'zzz'
  c = 6
  print(f"banana: {a}, apple: {b}, hello: {c}")

  will print "banana: 1, apple: zzz, hello: 6"
