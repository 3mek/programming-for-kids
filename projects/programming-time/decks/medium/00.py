# PROGRAMMING TIME
# 
# 
# Start with 1 card per
# player, put the rest
# face down (numbers 
# up).
#
# Each player has to
# interpret the code on
# their card, and look
# for the output at
# the top most card of
# the deck.
#
# First person to see
# their output, takes
# the card from the deck
# and it becomes their
# active card.
# 
# Player with most cards
# wins.
