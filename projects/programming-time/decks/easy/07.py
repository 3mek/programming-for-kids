# remove() element from a list takes
# a list and a value to remove it
# will walk over the list and skip
# all items equal to the value you
# want to remove, so
# remove([2,2,3,5],2) will return
# [3,5]. In python you can also do
# [2,4,6].remove(4) which will do
# remove "inplace" modifying the
# list itself.
