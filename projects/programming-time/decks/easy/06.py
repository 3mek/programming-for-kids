# A square root of a number is a
# value that, when multiplied by
# itself, gives the number. Example:
# 4*4 = 16, so a square root of 16
# is 4. Newton's method of finding
# the square root of x:
# root = (x + (n / x))/2 where x
# is any guess which can be assumed
# to be n or 1.
#
# We will run the algorithm 10 times
# to get good approximations
