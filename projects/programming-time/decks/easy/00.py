#
# Start with 1 card per player, put
# the rest face down (code down).
#
# Each player interprets the code on
# their card, and says the output,
# if the output is correct, they get
# a new card from the deck. Wherever
# you see ⚂ you must roll a dice to
# get the value.
#
# All players work together to
# defeat an evil computer program.
# Their computer needs 30 bytes of
# memory to beat the evil computer,
# each card you solve adds 1 byte of
# memory to the players' computer.
# The goal of the game is to solve
# 30 cards as a team.
