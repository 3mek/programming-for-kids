#
# Start with 1 card per player, put
# the rest face down (code down).
#
# Each player takes turn to
# interpret the code on their card,
# and say the output, if the output
# is correct, get a new card from
# the deck. Wherever you see ⚂ you
# must roll a dice to get the value.
#
# All players work together to
# defeat an evil computer
# program. Their computer needs 30
# bytes of memory to beat the evil
# computer, each card you solve adds
# 1 byte of memory to the player's
# computer. The goal of the game is
# to solve 30 cards together.
