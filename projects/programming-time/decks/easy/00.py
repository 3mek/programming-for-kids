# Start with 1 card per player, put
# the rest face down (code down).
#
# Each player takes turn to
# interpret the code on their card,
# and say the output, if the output
# is correct, get a new card from
# the deck. Wherever you see ⚂ you
# must roll a dice to get the value.
#
# The player with most cards wins.
