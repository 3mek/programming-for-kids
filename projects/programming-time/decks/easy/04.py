# The RSA algorithm is possibly the
# most used encryption algorithm in
# the world.
# in our example we use small prime
# numbers, but 1528622835711533 and 
# 2178583086560517094530555255075673
# are also prime numbers.

p = 11 # must be prime number
q = 17 # must be prime number
e = 7 # prime number between
      # (p-q)*(q-1), in our case
      # (11-1)*(17-1) = 160
      # so `e` must be a prime
      # number > 1 and < 160,
      # so I picked 7 as its also
      # my lucky number.
N = p * q # 187
