# `import` loads a module, a module
# is a just a bunch of code you are
# adding to your program because it
# helps you to solve a problem,
# e.g. the datetime module gives you
# functionality to get the current
# date and time. You can also
# download modules for python using
# the `pip3` command. Some modules
# are coming directly with python,
# like `random` and `datetime`.
