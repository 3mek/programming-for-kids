# A dictionary is a super nice way
# to organize data so that you can
# access things by their name or
# key. Unlike lists where we need to
# know the position of a value we
# need in order to use it, or we
# have to iterate over the whole
# list to see if we can find the
# value we are looking for.
# Dictionaries allow us to instantly
# lookup and find a value by its
# key.  The ASCII table is an
# example of a dictionary, from
# character (key) to its ASCII code
# (value)
