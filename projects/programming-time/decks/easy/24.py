# A dictionary is a kind of a list
# where you can access things
# by their name or key, instead
# of by index.
# Imagine table of contents in a
# book, you have 'Chapter 6' on
# page 263, so the key is 'Chapter
# 6', the value is 263.
# Or in the back of the book, you
# have an Index, where you can see
# which word is on which pages
# like "strings" -> pages 2,3,6


x = {
  'a': 'hello', # [@][@]
  'b': 'world'
}

print(x['a'])
