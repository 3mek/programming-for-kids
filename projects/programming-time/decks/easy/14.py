# Sorting a list is quite common,

# `sort`, that sorts in-place, so it
# will just modify the list itself,
# without returning anything. This
# is called mutating, like the
# teenage mutant ninja turtles, they
# changed from turtles to ninja
# turtles, so they mutated.  After
# that the list will be sorted in
# ascending order (smaller numbers
# first).

# reverse() does what it says,
# inplace it will reverse the list,
# it takes first and last elements
# and swaps them, then the second
# and pre-last, and so on. Again
# mutating the list.
