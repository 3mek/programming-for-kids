## [DAY-136] For; Arrays; Memory

Lets make a super simple C program

Just to get familiar witht he syntax, it does not use indentation to group code, but {}, and also each variable has to have known type (size), e.g we have to tell the C compiler (compiler is a program that takes the text code and transforms it into machine code) that  `i` is of type `int` which on our computer is exactly 4 bytes long.

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        sum += 10;
    }

    printf("%d\n", sum);
}
```

When you execute `gcc -o foo foo.c` (if you save the program in foo.c), it will make the binary `foo`, do `cat foo` to see the actual binary made from the compiler. If you run `objdump -D foo` you will see the assembly code and the machine code corresponding to it.

`cat foo`:
```

                                                                    8d
                                                                      /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib&`)h?UH??H???E??E??E??}?d??E???

```

Because its a binary file, most of the bytes are not actually printable ASCII characters, you can use `hexdump` to see the byte's values:

`hexdump -C foo`

`addl` meand `add`, `jmp` means jump and so forth. This is not important for now, the point is that `gcc` which is a popular C compiler, will take your code and make it into machine code.

Lets have another example:


FizzBuzz

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (i % 15 == 0) {
            printf("fizzbuzz\n");
        } else if (i % 5 == 0) {
            printf("buzz\n");
        } else if (i % 3 == 0) {
            printf("fizz\n");
        } else {
            printf("%d\n",i);
        }
    }
}
```

What is your name?

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char input[20] = {0};
    while(1) {
        printf("What is your name: ");
        scanf("%s",input);
        printf("\nHello %s\n",input);
    }
}
```

You see how we say `char input[20]` which means we habe 20 elements of type `char` pointed by the input variable, it is literally just a pointer to some memory, and we can use `input[1]` to go to the address `input` plus 1 byte. Same with `int x[10]`, if we do x[3], it will go to the address pointed by `x` and add 3 * 4 to it.

We can make interesting bugs like that, because nobody will check if we go and read somewhere outside of the defined array:


```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char input[20] = {0};
    int b = 5;
    while(1) {
        printf("What is your name: ");
        scanf("%s",input);
        printf("\nHello %s\n",input);

        for (int i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
            printf("  %d -> %d -> %c\n", i, input[i],input[i]);
        }
    }
}

```

You will see some garbage from element 20 to 39, because it will actually go and read beyond the input bounderioes.
