## [DAY-48] Basics of Basics

How big can a string be?

Your computer has limited amount of memory, usually 8 gigabytes, that is a lot of memory. 8 * 1024 megabytes * 1024 kilobytes * 1024 bytes, so 8589934592 bytes. What if we make python create a string with more characters than memory?

NB: before you try that, save all your files because you might have to restart your computer, depending on the operation system version.

```
try_me = 'x' * (8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
print(len(try_me))
```

If you can not press any buttons after that, or the mouse is not working, you will have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to turn your computer off and then turn it back on.

lets try another thing

```
def forever(n):
  print(n)
  forever(n+1)

forever(1)
```

this will throw a weird error

```
RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while pickling an object
```

Don't be afraid of it, every time you call a function, a little bit of memory has to be used, and this memory is released when the function returns, now imagine a function that calls itself, so you get this:

```
forever(1)
  forever(1+1)
    forever(1+1+1)
      forever(....)
```


So the memory for those function is never released, and this error just says, you cant go and call so many functions that never return. But you will see on your system you can have around 10000 functions that are waiting for their child to return.

Play with it a bit.

```
def one(n):
  print("one", n)
  two(n+1)

def two(n):
  print("two", n)
  one(n+1)

one(1)

```

```
import random
game = [
    ['What is the capital of France?','Paris','London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    ['What is the capital of Japan?','Tokyo','London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    ["What is Jane's favorite food?",'Popcorn','Pizza','Popcorn','Cucumber','Sushi']
]


while True:
    quiz = random.choice(game)
    print(quiz[0])
    for index, possible in enumerate(quiz):
        if index >= 2:
            print(possible)
    answer = input('What is your answer: ')

    if answer == quiz[1]:
        print("✨✨✨ CORRECT ✨✨✨")
    else:
        print("INCORRECT")
```

see `enumerate` is quite handy, you get the index of something and its value while you are doing the `for`

```
x = ['a','b','c','d']
for index ,element in enumerate(x):
  print(index)
  print('  ' + element)
```


make it easier to read:

```
import random
QUESTION_IDX = 0
ANSWER_IDX = 1
game = [
    ['What is the capital of France?','Paris','London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    ['What is the capital of Japan?','Tokyo','London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    ["What is Jane's favorite food?",'Popcorn','Pizza','Popcorn','Cucumber','Sushi']
]


while True:
    quiz = random.choice(game)
    print(quiz[QUESTION_IDX])

    for index, possible in enumerate(quiz):
        if index >= ANSWER_IDX+1:
            print(possible)
    answer = input('What is your answer: ')

    if answer == quiz[ANSWER_IDX]:
        print("✨✨✨ CORRECT ✨✨✨")
    else:
        print("INCORRECT")
```

See how just using QUESTION_IDX and ANSWER_IDX instead of 0 and 1 it is easier to read. Now lets try a completely different way:

```
import random
game = [
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of France?",
        "answer": "Paris",
        "possible": ['London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the capital of Japan?",
        "answer": "Tokyo",
        "possible": ['London','Paris','Berlin','Tokyo'],
    },  
]


while True:
    quiz = random.choice(game)
    print(quiz["question"])
    for p in quiz["possible"]:
        print(' --> ' + p)
    answer = input('What is your answer: ')

    if answer == quiz["answer"]:
        print("✨✨✨ CORRECT ✨✨✨")
    else:
        print("INCORRECT")
```

This is just another way to do it, see in the list we can store those strange things. We will talk about them in a couple of weeks, I just wanted to show you how clean it is when
