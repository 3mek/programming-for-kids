## [DAY-48] Basics of Basics

How big can a string be?

Your computer has limited amount of memory, usually 8 gigabytes, that is a lot of memory. 8 * 1024 megabytes * 1024 kilobytes * 1024 bytes, so 8589934592 bytes. What if we make python create a string with more characters than memory?

NB: before you try that, save all your files because you might have to restart your computer, depending on the operation system version.

```
try_me = 'x' * (8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024)
print(len(try_me))
```

If you can not press any buttons after that, or the mouse is not working, you will have to hold the power button for 10 seconds to turn your computer off and then turn it back on.
