## [DAY-185] Generalization

Today we will build three different versions of snakes and ladders to illustrate different approaches.

We will use super small Snakes and Ladders game with the following rules:

* there are 9 squares, from 0 to 8
* 0 -> 0
* 1 -> 2
* 2 -> 2
* 3 -> 3
* 4 -> 2
* 5 -> 7
* 6 -> 0
* 7 -> 7
* 8 -> 8

1. While and If, most basic implementation. In this implementation if we do 99 squares or we want to render a board, or we want to make the game more interesting to roll the dice twice or something like that, everything will just explode in complexity.

```
player1 = 0
while True:
    print("player board position: ", player1)
    dice = int(input("dice roll> "))

    player1 += dice
    if player1 == 1:
        player1 = 3
    elif player1 == 4:
        player1 = 2
    elif player1 == 5:
        player1 = 7
    elif player1 == 6:
        player1 = 0

```

2. Think about the rules of the game and what is a bit more abstract way to think about the them. The only rule actually is: if you land on the square you move wherever the square says, could be 0 (stay there), +steps or -steps. This is an example implementation where we just keep the state of each square in a list, square index 1 moves you to index 3 and so on.

```
board = [
    0,
    2,   # 1 -> 3
    0,
    0,
    -2,  # 4 -> 2
    2,   # 5 -> 7
    -6,  # 6 -> 0
    0,
    0
]

player1 = 8
while True:
    print("player board index: ", player1)
    dice = int(input("dice roll> "))
    player1 += dice

    if player1 >= len(board) - 1:
        print("finished")
        break

    snake_or_ladder = board[player1]
    player1 += snake_or_ladder
```

The whole game is actually encoded in those two lines:

```
    snake_or_ladder = board[player1]
    player1 += snake_or_ladder
```

See how different this is? The size of the code is very similar in lines, but this version is so much easier to change and to extend. For example if we want to display the board, now we can just pass the board list to some `render` function and be done. This is actually not possible in the first version with the if conditions unless we almost duplicate the whole program.


3. There is one more thing we could do to simplify it a bit, and that is to split the board from the input. So that we could move it maybe in a separate file (board.py) if we want. Separating the user input from the board action is quite nice because now it will be super easy to add mouse click functionality, and board rendering.


```
class Board:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = 0
        self.squares = [
            0,
            2,   # 1 -> 3
            0,
            0,
            -2,  # 4 -> 2
            2,   # 5 -> 7
            -6,  # 6 -> 0
            0,
            0
        ]

    def move(self, dice):
        position = self.player + dice
        if position >= len(self.squares) - 1:
            return True

        self.player += self.squares[position]
        return False

#################################################

b = Board()
while True:
    print("player board position: ", b.player)
    roll = int(input("dice roll> "))
    if b.move(roll):
        print('finished')
        break
```

Using https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ as a guide. There are many ways to read documentation, try to spend some time just brawsing through it. Another way is to go to the example section and see if you can find examples that can help you solve your problem.

This is a snippet with examples taken from pyautogui's page:

```
>>> import pyautogui

>>> screenWidth, screenHeight = pyautogui.size() # Get the size of the primary monitor.
>>> screenWidth, screenHeight
(2560, 1440)

>>> currentMouseX, currentMouseY = pyautogui.position() # Get the XY position of the mouse.
>>> currentMouseX, currentMouseY
(1314, 345)

>>> pyautogui.moveTo(100, 150) # Move the mouse to XY coordinates.

>>> pyautogui.click()          # Click the mouse.
>>> pyautogui.click(100, 200)  # Move the mouse to XY coordinates and click it.
>>> pyautogui.click('button.png') # Find where button.png appears on the screen and click it.

>>> pyautogui.move(400, 0)      # Move the mouse 400 pixels to the right of its current position.
>>> pyautogui.doubleClick()     # Double click the mouse.
>>> pyautogui.moveTo(500, 500, duration=2, tween=pyautogui.easeInOutQuad)  # Use tweening/easing function to move mouse over 2 seconds.

>>> pyautogui.write('Hello world!', interval=0.25)  # type with quarter-second pause in between each key
>>> pyautogui.press('esc')     # Press the Esc key. All key names are in pyautogui.KEY_NAMES

>>> with pyautogui.hold('shift'):  # Press the Shift key down and hold it.
        pyautogui.press(['left', 'left', 'left', 'left'])  # Press the left arrow key 4 times.
>>> # Shift key is released automatically.

>>> pyautogui.hotkey('ctrl', 'c') # Press the Ctrl-C hotkey combination.

>>> pyautogui.alert('This is the message to display.') # Make an alert box appear and pause the program until OK is clicked.
```

> use `pyautogui.position()` to find the accurate positions for your screen.
```
import pyautogui
import time
while True:
    pyautogui.click(305,10)
    pyautogui.click(117,252)
    pyautogui.write('dad', interval=0.25)
    pyautogui.click(185, 395)
    pyautogui.write('hello world!', interval=0.20)
    pyautogui.click(935, 1132)
    time.sleep(1)

Have some fun with it pranking your parents :) _but not too much_.
