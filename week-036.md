## [DAY-246] strings

```
# make a function to count how many times a given character
# appears in a string

def count(c, s):
    # .. count how many times `c` appears in `s`
    # example string s "hello"
    # example character c "l"
    return 0



n = count("l","hello")
print(f"character l appears {n} times")

# what would happen if we do: n = count(1, [1,2,3,4,1,5])

```
